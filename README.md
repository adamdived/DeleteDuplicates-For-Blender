# DeleteDuplicates-For-Blender
I wrote this script because i needed to optimize large industrial CAD meshes for game engines like Unreal or Unity. Many of these industrial meshes had thousands of duplicates of the same objects overlapping each other. Selecting them one by one, trying to find the duplicates, were such a pain. So the script automates the process of identifying and removing duplicates in a Blender scene, comparing the space, volume, position, and vertices of each object. If these objects share the same properties, it deletes all duplicates except for one instance.

You're welcome. :)
